    start the install process.

  - After that is done and you are chrooted into
    the new installation. Set your timezone info
    with 'timedatectl' command.

  - Finally, you can install a bootloader, run my
    'setup-user.sh' script and don't forget to
    'mkinitcpio -p linux' with quotes ofcourse.

  - Note: You can also install dwm with my custom
    install script for that, in chrooted environ-
    ment.

    Just do the following to install dwm with or
    without my custom config.def.h. Type,
    'su liveuser' without quotes. Then you should
    be able to type 'cd' press enter, Finally.
    Launch 'dl_repos.sh' script in /usr/bin. That
    should download all repos needed for suckless
    dwm to work out of the box. Also, you can use
    it to apply my custom patch and install the
    packages as well.
